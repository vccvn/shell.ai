  <h1>Yesterday by The Beatles</h1>
  <p>Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away<br>
  Now it looks as though they're here to stay<br>
  Oh, I believe in yesterday<br>
  <br>
  Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be<br>
  There's a shadow hanging over me.<br>
  Oh, yesterday came suddenly<br>
  <br>
  Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say<br>
  I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday<br>
  <br>
  Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br>
  Now I need a place to hide away<br>
  Oh, I believe in yesterday<br>
  <br>
  Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say<br>
  I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday<br>
  <br>
  Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play<br>
  Now I need a place to hide away<br>
  Oh, I believe in yesterday<br>
  Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm</p>
